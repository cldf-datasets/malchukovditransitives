baou1238-lparam1,baou1238,lparam1,multiple constructions,lparam1-c2,"(1) The basic ditransitives take a Double Object Construction which comes in two kinds: (a) with 'show', the Double Object Construction is unmarked; (b) with 'give' (also 'bring' and 'steal'), the structure additionally involves a resumptive pronoun and is superficially identical to the internal R construction with R as a formal possessor. Like the possessive construction, it disallows two resumptive pronouns ('I gave him my money'). Yet extraction tests indicate that R and T are distinct NPs. (2) When the T is high (or higher than R) on person/animacy scales, then an alternative Serial Verb Construction based on 'take' is used. With 'give', only indefinite Ts appear in the Double Object Construction, definite Ts trigger a Serial Verb Construction. (3) Syntactic tests point at R primacy: (a) only R can be topicalized; (b) only R can be relativized; (c) R like P can be omitted with unspecified reference (?); (4) Some other tests are neutral: both R and T can be focalized/extracted.

(2) Syntactic behavior: (a) passivization: in indirective T, in secundative R; (b) antipassivization: some ditransitives permit shifted R demotion in the secundative pattern; (c) extraction (focusing; questions; relativization): according to Cooreman, only P/T can be extracted in the indirective pattern, but both T and R in the secundative pattern.

thai1261-lparam1,thai1261,lparam1,mixed alignment,lparam1-c3,"(1) An alternation of a prepositional and double object construction with canonical ditransitives; only the former is used when the T is heavy. Apart from heaviness, no obvious factors involved in the ditransitive alternation. (2) The word order is V T (Prep) R in both double object and a prepositional construction. (3) Passivization seems to follow alignment: T is passivized in the prepositional construction, while R is passivized in the double object construction (as discussed further with Kingkarn Thepkanjana, p.c.). In the literature, there are contradicting claims as to preferential passivization of T (Smyth) or R (SW), but this is due to the fact that diferent constructions are considered (not the one ditransitive construction with the “optional” preposition). Additionally, some uses of passive are infelicitous due to its adversative semantics. (4) Some peculiarities/restrictions noted in the literature are motivated structurally. Thus, SW notes that T unlike P/R does not allow for modification (by relative clause and question). But this is motivated by constituency (clearer for relative clauses which do not allow intraposition); note that if the T is right-dislocated, then it allows for modification.",,

(3) Relativization is neutral in a ditransitive construction (both objects relativized by gapping), but is indirective in monotransitive (requires preposition stranding to relativize R). (4) Yet other constructions/diagnostics show intrinsic alignment (a) passive is secundative even in the ditransitive indirective pattern(this may be explained by a ban against bare R stranding; (cf. ??The book was given Peter) (b) the same is true for reflexives and reciprocals; (c) animacy restrictions on T argument even in a ditransitive secundative constructions.",,

(4) Yet there is one property where T is unlike P/R: T cannot be pronominalized; this is related to the Definiteness Constraint.

Yet, in general, T is more P-like since it allows for the case alternation (DAT/NOM) under the same conditions (related to Animacy Hierarchy) as P; (3) another argument for indirective alignment (that carries over to the imperfective construction) is that in both cases only T can be passivized (also from a double dative pattern); (4) the only genuine double object pattern is found in causative constructions, where the causee may show the DAT/NOM alternation identical to P.",,
kett1243-lparam1,kett1243,lparam1,mixed alignment,lparam1-c3,"Ket has an open dative-allative construction with indirective flagging/indexing, and a closed class of ditransitives taking a double object construction. In the double object construction, indexing is usually secundative, but when the T is a 1/2 person pronoun, there is an alignment switch: the construction changes to the dative construction. Another peculiar feature of the double object construction is that the verb includes an “applicative” marker derived from the fossilized inanimate object-theme marker. Resultative passive: passivization is indirective in the dative construction, but blocked in the double object construction (with 'give'). Reflexives and reciprocals can be expressed through verbal indexing (object markers or special same-reference markers). In the double object construction, these markers predictably refer to the R in the dative construction and they predictably bind T (if animate), but (at least for reciprocals) can also bind R. Relativization: both R and T can be relativized by gapping in the double object construction, but in the dative construction, relativization of the R requires a resumptive pronoun. Event nominalization: in the dative construction, T can genitivize (like P), 'give' verbs participating in the double object construction do not form infinitives. There are three different 'give' verbs, one of them indirective, the two others neutral. The latter differ in aspectual properties (a special case of aspectual suppletion).",,

This is quite clear for cases when the secundative pattern is derived by a-applicative (e.g. topicalization applies only to promoted objects with a-marked verbs). What holds is that basic ditransitives may appear in either pattern (because many of them historically contain an “quasi-applicative” -a?). 3) Yet other transformation (topicalization, questions/extraction, relativization) apparently are indeed symmetric (i.e. apply both to first and second object), as the stranded/retained object need not be introduced by the ke preposition. With nominalization, apparently T can be “genetivized” (put into the possessor position) even from the secundative pattern (as bare R can be retained), which confirms general preference for T-genitivization. 4) Interesting lexical splits: several give verbs distributed into several classes (the suppletive give-me verb is basically monotransitive).

With secundative ditransitives agreement with R is suspended; interestingly, not only R but also T should be non-specific in that construction. In the indirective construction, T-indexing is suspended but again both objects should be non-specific. 4) Chintang has a special case of object to subject raising. Raising refer to agreement (indexing of an object on the matrix verb), hence it follows indexing alignment: it operate on secundative basis with basic ditransitives (and on indirective basis with caused motion verbs which have an indirective indexing). 5) Both reflexives ad reciprocals involve verbal derivation. Apparently, in both cases both R and T can be bound by A (although for reflexives the option of A binding T was not exemplified).",,
