Thus, it is a double object (dative-shifted) indexing construction. (2) Some other basic ditransitives have a secundative pattern in that R is marked in the first object-indexing slot (3) The majority pattern is indirective: the T is marked through the first object-indexing slot, while the R is marked by the applicative marker in combination with a second object marker. (4) Apparently the peculiarity of 'give' is explained by the fact that is retained now only in the form of the applicative marker (cf. Roberts 1987: 313). (5) Passive is of the impersonal topicalizing type: there are apparently no restrictions. (6) Relative clauses are internally headed, and there are no restrictions.

baou1238-lparam1,baou1238,lparam1,multiple constructions,lparam1-c3,"(1) The basic ditransitives take a Double Object Construction which comes in two kinds: (a) with 'show', the Double Object Construction is unmarked; (b) with 'give' (also 'bring' and 'steal'), the structure additionally involves a resumptive pronoun and is superficially identical to the internal R construction with R as a formal possessor. Like the possessive construction, it disallows two resumptive pronouns ('I gave him my money'). Yet extraction tests indicate that R and T are distinct NPs. (2) When the T is high (or higher than R) on person/animacy scales, then an alternative Serial Verb Construction based on 'take' is used. With 'give', only indefinite Ts appear in the Double Object Construction, definite Ts trigger a Serial Verb Construction. (3) Syntactic tests point at R primacy: (a) only R can be topicalized; (b) only R can be relativized; (c) R like P can be omitted with unspecified reference (?); (4) Some other tests are neutral: both R and T can be focalized/extracted. (5) Others are non-committal: reflexives/reciprocals only from the serial verb construction, since both objects are definite and coreferential.",,

(2) Syntactic behavior: (a) passivization: in indirective T, in secundative R; (b) antipassivization: some ditransitives permit shifted R demotion in the secundative pattern; (c) extraction (focusing; questions; relativization): according to Cooreman, only P/T can be extracted in the indirective pattern, but both T and R in the secundative pattern.

(4) Animacy effects: if T is 1,2 person, ditransitive 'give' is replaced by 'send'. (5) 'Send' forms an exceptional allative construction with ergative T (probably modeled on ergative causatives).

thai1261-lparam1,thai1261,lparam1,mixed alignment,lparam1-c2,"(1) An alternation of a prepositional and double object construction with canonical ditransitives; only the former is used when the T is heavy. Apart from heaviness, no obvious factors involved in the ditransitive alternation. (2) The word order is V T (Prep) R in both double object and a prepositional construction. (3) Passivization seems to follow alignment: T is passivized in the prepositional construction, while R is passivized in the double object construction (as discussed further with Kingkarn Thepkanjana, p.c.). In the literature, there are contradicting claims as to preferential passivization of T (Smyth) or R (SW), but this is due to the fact that diferent constructions are considered (not the one ditransitive construction with the “optional” preposition). Additionally, some uses of passive are infelicitous due to its adversative semantics. (4) Some peculiarities/restrictions noted in the literature are motivated structurally. Thus, SW notes that T unlike P/R does not allow for modification (by relative clause and question). But this is motivated by constituency (clearer for relative clauses which do not allow intraposition); note that if the T is right-dislocated, then it allows for modification.",,

Benefactive Rs are adjuncts and not indexed. (2) Syntactic processes are indirective (e.g. pseudo-passives, secondary predicates), but for some purposes, dative is treated as a core argument (e.g. relativization). (3) Indirective indexing is not confined to canonical ditransitives, as it extends to constructions with external possessors and ethical datives.",,
soch1239-lparam1,soch1239,lparam1,multiple constructions,lparam1-c3,"(1) Semantic effects: monotransitive indirective for caused motion vs. ditransitive for transfer of possession (cf. dative alternation). (2) Animacy effects: if T is animate, alignment is rather indirective; if inanimate, then rather secundative (the alignment is evident in which object conditions direct/inverse alternation). (3) Relativization is neutral in a ditransitive construction (both objects relativized by gapping), but is indirective in monotransitive (requires preposition stranding to relativize R). (4) Yet other constructions/diagnostics show intrinsic alignment (a) passive is secundative even in the ditransitive indirective pattern(this may be explained by a ban against bare R stranding; (cf. ??The book was given Peter) (b) the same is true for reflexives and reciprocals; (c) animacy restrictions on T argument even in a ditransitive secundative constructions.",,
ewee1241-lparam1,ewee1241,lparam1,neutral,lparam1-c4,"(1) According to Essegbey, in the double object construction (DOC), T is the main object. (2) Among the few “symmetric” properties where T equals R are: word order (but V-T-R is more frequent), and quantifier binding (depends on word order) (3) Other properties are indicative of T-primacy: (a) only T/P can be questioned by movement only (b) only T/P can be “genitivized” by preposing in nominalizations (c) only T/P can be fronted/preposed (d) only T/P can be promoted by a nya-construction. (4) Yet there is one property where T is unlike P/R: T cannot be pronominalized; this is related to the Definiteness Constraint.

There is also some coding evidence for secundative alignment: the form of weak pronouns, also the behavior of the boundedness marker. (3) SVC shows indirective alignment for the same syntactic tests. (4) IPC is indirective in alignment; yet for a number of constructions there are no superiority effects (extractions, multiple questions).

kett1243-lparam1,kett1243,lparam1,mixed alignment,lparam1-c2,"Ket has an open dative-allative construction with indirective flagging/indexing, and a closed class of ditransitives taking a double object construction. In the double object construction, indexing is usually secundative, but when the T is a 1/2 person pronoun, there is an alignment switch: the construction changes to the dative construction. Another peculiar feature of the double object construction is that the verb includes an “applicative” marker derived from the fossilized inanimate object-theme marker. Resultative passive: passivization is indirective in the dative construction, but blocked in the double object construction (with 'give'). Reflexives and reciprocals can be expressed through verbal indexing (object markers or special same-reference markers). In the double object construction, these markers predictably refer to the R in the dative construction and they predictably bind T (if animate), but (at least for reciprocals) can also bind R. Relativization: both R and T can be relativized by gapping in the double object construction, but in the dative construction, relativization of the R requires a resumptive pronoun. Event nominalization: in the dative construction, T can genitivize (like P), 'give' verbs participating in the double object construction do not form infinitives. There are three different 'give' verbs, one of them indirective, the two others neutral. The latter differ in aspectual properties (a special case of aspectual suppletion).",,

In the basic double object construction, there are animacy effects (a kind of differential object marking): only animate objects take P-case. Passivization is non-promotional, with no restrictions. Relativization is internal, with no restrictions. Verbal plural markers pertain to P/T arguments. 'Give' verbs: one is a causative of 'take', another is basic 'give' (prolonged object).
