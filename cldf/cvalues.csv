constr12-cparam3,constr12,cparam3,cparam3-c4,,ch001lithompson1981[579 f.],either T or R (but not both),There is relativization by nominalization (gapping) on objects and obliques. Hence relativization of both T and (bare) R should be possible (no examples of relativization from a ditransitive double object construction are given though).

In ditransitives both can be relativized. But out of context the noun phrase head of a non-subject ditransitive is interpreted as R (ex. 7016). Note: Relative clauses with 1st/2nd person R arguments can be cross-referenced for both R and P (cf. ex. 7017)."

constr54-cparam3,constr54,cparam3,cparam3-c4,ex12,ch001lichtenberk1983[555 ff.],either T or R (but not both),Relativization is postnominal finite (at least not nominalized or participial).
