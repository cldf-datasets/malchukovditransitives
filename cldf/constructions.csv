A is indexed by still another set of prefixes in the pre-root slot. – A variant of this construction (found with some other verbs) is the one where indirective agreement is introduced (followed) by applicative-like preverbs/relational particles; see the second example with 'tell' that uses the relational particle -a (see also benefactive construction under Derived ditransitives).",ex353;ex488,hewitt-1989,[A R T obj[T].obj[R].subj[A].V] –

In other verbs he (following Foley) suggests that indirective indexing developed from reanalysis of a verb ad auxiliary into the single verb a form: o-V + o-Aux-s -> o-V-r-s.
