Like the possessive construction, it disallows two resumptive pronouns ('I gave him my money'). Yet extraction tests indicate that R and T are distinct NPs.

(3) Passivization seems to follow alignment: T is passivized in the prepositional construction, while R is passivized in the double object construction (as discussed further with Kingkarn Thepkanjana, p.c.). In the literature, there are contradicting claims as to preferential passivization of T (Smyth) or R (SW), but this is due to the fact that diferent constructions are considered (not the one ditransitive construction with the “optional” preposition). Additionally, some uses of passive are infelicitous due to its adversative semantics. (4) Some peculiarities/restrictions noted in the literature are motivated structurally. Thus, SW notes that T unlike P/R does not allow for modification (by relative clause and question).

In the double object construction, indexing is usually secundative, but when the T is a 1/2 person pronoun, there is an alignment switch: the construction changes to the dative construction. Another peculiar feature of the double object construction is that the verb includes an “applicative” marker derived from the fossilized inanimate object-theme marker. Resultative passive: passivization is indirective in the dative construction, but blocked in the double object construction (with 'give'). Reflexives and reciprocals can be expressed through verbal indexing (object markers or special same-reference markers). In the double object construction, these markers predictably refer to the R in the dative construction and they predictably bind T (if animate), but (at least for reciprocals) can also bind R. Relativization: both R and T can be relativized by gapping in the double object construction, but in the dative construction, relativization of the R requires a resumptive pronoun. Event nominalization: in the dative construction, T can genitivize (like P), 'give' verbs participating in the double object construction do not form infinitives. There are three different 'give' verbs, one of them indirective, the two others neutral. The latter differ in aspectual properties (a special case of aspectual suppletion).",,,
