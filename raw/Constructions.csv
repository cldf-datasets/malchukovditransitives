24,Quasi-incorporated T construction,T=AGRpos V,"T takes a pronominal enclitic otherwise used for possessive agreement. Yet, it is not an internal R construction, but rather a complex predicate, where the object agreement refers to R “ignoring” a quasi-incorporated T (I poison-gave-him = I poisoned him).

29,Double Object (fluid alignment),(A) R T obj[T].subj[A].V,"This construction is formally identical to the secundative construction, but the alignment is dependent on the animacy hierarchy:
Secundative (as in ex. 1503) can change to indirective alignment (as in ex. 1731), if  T is 1st person; object agreement in ex. 1731 is with the 1st person T.",6,2,1503,262,

The A may appear either preverbally or – if 3rd person pronoun – postverbally; in that case it follows the resumptive pronoun (if any). It is used when R is affected (to the benefit/detriment).",15,2,1515,264,130

Its use with (?some of) the ‘steal’-verbs still has to be confirmed, since this construction is indistinguishable from the possessive construction which is equally unmarked.",2561,2,1520,36,
,,,,,,1748,,
47,Prepositional-Applicative Construction,A V T li (APPL) R,"The construction is neutral in indexing. As for flagging, it might be regarded as indirective, as R is introduced by the applicative particle li/ni ‘to, for’. Yet it is not clear whether the particle flags R, as elsewhere (Schaefer & Egbokhare 2008++: 7) it is stated that li/ni belongs to postverbal particles, which suggests that it is rather a postposed marker of T. 
Most ‘manner of motion’ verbs (scoop. ‘pick’, ‘fetch’, ‘uproot’, etc.) can be used in this construction to denote transfer of possession. The use of the allative marker in this construction would imply temporary possession.
Some verbs like ré do not appear outside this construction.",2561,2,1521,36,

49,Double object construction,[A subj[A].V R T] –,"T and R are both unmarked postverbal noun phrases, with R preceding T as noun phrases (p. 11), and with T preceding R as pronominal prefixes (p. 181). Either T or R may be made subject of the passive (p. 65, p. 127). Either T or R can appear as reflexive prefix (but can both simultaneously? examples only for R) (p. 66). Object-subject reversal, which applies to P, applies to neither T nor R (p. 145). Both T and R can be left-topicalized, including simultaneously - in the example given, the order is R before T; R and T cannot both be right-topicalized simultaneously (p. 203), though presumably either of them can individually. Indexing and noun phrase are usually in complementary distribution for non-subjects, but indexing is obligatory under topicalization.",18,2,1523,,

Other comment:

Inversion effects in ditransitive construction: the form of the secondary O (T), depends on the person of A and R (primary O). (cf. similarly, the form of primary O depends on the person of subject; see monotransitives). 

Note the inversion effects in a ditransitive construction: if both A and R are SAP pronouns (1,2), then T (the secondary O) remains in the DIR form; otherwise it takes the OBL article:
(19) Enaa pasi vaasus avameam a meha taba
1SG will teach OBJ.2PL.IMM DIR.ART other thing
‘I will teach you another thing’
(20) Me paa pasi vaasusu ri (bari) bona meha taba
and TAM teach OBJ.3PL (OBJ3SG) OBJ.ART other thing
‘And he taught them another thing’
NB in (19) T is in DIR since A is a SAP pronoun; in (20) T is marked by OBJ article (and optionally introduced by the OBJ form of the 3rd person pronoun; called 4th person pronoun by M).",2191,2,1602,466,

5396146380,Take Serial Construction,A de T V R,"The Take Serial Construction can be used when the T is definite (under such conditions, the Double Object Construction is not possible with many verbs). It can also be used with some verbs that do allow definite Ts in the Double Object Construction. There are also some verbs ('request', 'charge') that do not allow definite themes even in this construction. Apparently the 'take' meaning of the serial verb de is still present in the construction (Osam 1996: 65). Note also that de can also be used to express instrumentals.",70,2,5396155599,482,64-69
