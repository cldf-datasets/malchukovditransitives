2) Obviation:

Rhodes (1990: 411): obviation control is determined by a GR hierarchy: SU >PO >SO",,,
186,90,,,"a)	Antipassives
p. 148. Antipassive construction: the verb is detransitivized, P is introduced as oblique. Note that this demoted object shows similarities to T of ditransitives with regard to special oblique nominalizer in extractions (p. 155).
Antipassives are impossible from ditransitives; see the ungrammatical (25b) p. 155.
b)	Control alternations:
In monotransitives there is a control alteration on the verb: the verb takes a ‘limited control suffix if the action is spontaneous (look+lim.con  see, etc). However with ditransitives limited control suffix cannot be used as it pertains only to basic Ps, “to the final object which is also the initial object of the clause” (G, p. 117).",,,
190,90,,,"p. 222. Antipassive by deletion of nasalisation index (for animate Ps); yet the verbs form is rather transitive (rather TI – transitive inanimate). Antipassive conditions demotion of a T-argument, which can be either introduced prepositionally, or - with ditransitive verbs -  in a kind of relative structure; 
cf. (22b) gave-he [has chicken] to-child. ‘he will give some chicken to the child’
In any case antipassive targets T, not R arguments, thus construction is indirective. 
i)	Inverse
The choice between direct and inverse depends on the status of subject and object wrt. (person) hierarchy (1/2 > 3 > 3/obv). In constructions with animate Ts, the inverse is used when T is higher than A (T-inverse); in constructions with inanimate Ts, the inverse is used when R is higher than A (R-inverse). Unlike direct forms inverse forms do not distinguish between animate/inanimate Os.
(1)	T-inverse 
cf. direct ditransitive construction (with animate T) in (14)  inverse (15) ‘She will give me to Peter’ (A<T)..
Note that the same double object construction is used; but the form of the verb changes.

j)	Object preposing

(10a) Kofi AUX money give Ami; (10b) *Kofi AUX Ami give money.",,,

Matsuoka argues for a distinction between pass-verbs (i.e. caused motion verbs) and show-verbs (i.e. canonical ditransitives) with respect to the inchoative -causative alternation (a morphologically irregular transitivity alternation).
With pass-verbs T is subject of the inchoative verb,

2) Clefts 
Sadakane & Koizumi 1995:
Dative marked Rs but not dative marked Goals behabve like (core) cases w.r.t. clefting/extraction: they do not require retention of ni in the focus position:
see the grammatical (18a) “’Its Mika that Emi gave the bouqet of roses’ and the less grammatical (17a) with ni retained. 

In this respect dative marked Goals behave in the opposite way (require retention of ni in the focus position).But also external Benefactives (of yak ‘bake’ and kaw ‘buy’)behave like postpositions in that respect (do not allow clefting unsupported by ni, but also Quantifier Float).",,,

In ‘sentence-internal’ focus-construction, the focus immediately follows the focused constituent; thus no restrictions. There is another use of focus markers in sentence final position, which can be used only to focus core participants: sentence/predicate focus (p. 278). If the sentence final-focus construction the focus is on the whole clause or VP; normally only core arguments can be in the focus domain in that case; cf. example of T-questioning in (451).",,,
