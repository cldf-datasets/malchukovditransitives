Another peculiar feature of the double object construction is that the verb includes an “applicative” marker derived from the fossilized inanimate object-theme marker. Resultative passive: passivization is indirective in the dative construction, but blocked in the double object construction (with 'give'). Reflexives and reciprocals can be expressed through verbal indexing (object markers or special same-reference markers).

a)	canonical (mono)transitive construction has ergative features combined with direct-inverse features: If P is animate it is indexed by “absolutive agreement”, if P is inanimate then a sort of antipassive constructyion s used where A is marked by the “ergative agreement”. 
b)	Less canonical transitives (like ‘meet’. also psych-verbs?) show a different indexing alternation: pegative-dative. If the second (more P-like) argument is 1,2, person, it is indexed by the “dative” indexing, if P is 3rd p. (sg), then it is unmarked and the first argument is marked instead. 
3)	Canonical ditransitives show the same pegative-dative pattern as less canonical monotransitives: R like P is indexed by the dative agreement if 1,2 person, while with 3rd person R, A is indexed instead by the “ergative” agreement.
